    <h1>ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ Madrid, Spain ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸</h1>
        <p>
         Madrid was our last stop of the 2 week journey. It was here where I met 2 of my best friends, Ellie and Zhara. It was here where I learned that you don't need to conform into friend groups in order to meet cool people! </p>
         <p>Zhara is from New Jersey, and Ellie is from Wisconsin, which also showed me that the best adventures you can have may come from people with totally different lives from yours :D
    </p>

    <p>For lunch, we stopped at a place called "Caja Sorpresa" also called the Kawaii Cafe in Madrid. We all ordered some marble soda together, and I decided to try out the orange flavor while Ellie and Zhara both had blue raspberry flavored marble soda.</p>

        <p>Here's some Spanish delacacies I tried in an outdoors restaurant in Puerta de Sol. (I unfortunately forgot to take pictures of my food during this time...)</p>
        <p>The first image is a Calamari Sandwich, which is a sandwich made with white bread and deep fried squid rings. The second picture is a sweet, Spanish alcoholic cocktail beverage:</p>

    <p>I also went to a modern art museum in Madrid. Here are some famous paintings I saw!</p>
    <p>This first artwork isn't a painting, but a really pretty picture of graffiti I took :)</p>

    <p>After my journey to the modern art museum, I headed to our assigned restaurant to eat dinner. The tomato soup appetizer was decent, not great.</p>

    <figcaption>Some kind of fried pork dish(?)</figcaption>
    <p>The fried pork dish was not that good in my opinion, probably because it was deep fried in the worst way possible, and I was absolutely full from Horchata (rice juice) before dinner.</p>
    <p>If there is a snack I could absolutely 1000% recommend while you're in Madrid, definetly try their authentic Horchata and Churros from Churreria Chocolateria!</p>
