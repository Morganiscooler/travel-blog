    <h1>ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ Barcelona, Catelonia ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸</h1>
        <p>
         Barcelona was my second to last stop for the 2 week journey that I had been travelling through.</p>
         <p> During this time, I learned about the unique architecture unique to Barcelona, as well as the unique language of this autonamous region known as Catalonia!

    <p>First, our group moved from Pont du Gard to a temporary 45 minute driver's break area. Here I tried a random restaurant's Pallela. </p>

  <p>Next, our travel group arrived at a hotel near the calm beaches of Calella, Barcelona. </p>
     <p>The hotel had a salt water pool, and I played a few swimming games with the travel group.</p>

        <p>Here's some Spanish delacacies I tried in an outdoors restaurant in Puerta de Sol. (I unfortunately forgot to take pictures of my food during this time...)</p>
        <p>The first image is a Calamari Sandwich, which is a sandwich made with white bread and deep fried squid rings. The second picture is a sweet, Spanish alcoholic cocktail beverage:</p>

    <p>I also went to a modern art museum in Madrid. Here are some famous paintings I saw!</p>
    <p>This first artwork isn't a painting, but a really pretty picture of graffiti I took :)</p>

    <p>After my journey to the modern art museum, I headed to our assigned restaurant to eat dinner. The tomato soup appetizer was decent, not great.</p>

    <figcaption>Some kind of fried pork dish(?)</figcaption>
    <p>The fried pork dish was not that good in my opinion, probably because it was deep fried in the worst way possible, and I was absolutely full from Horchata (rice juice) before dinner.</p>
    <p>If there is a snack I could absolutely 1000% recommend while you're in Madrid, definetly try their authentic Horchata and Churros from Churreria Chocolateria!</p>
